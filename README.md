# Spatial Statistics Learning Group
This repository contains info and materials for the Spatial Statistics Reading Group (SSRG) set up for the CONSHA and [P3H](https://impact.psu.edu/story/forecasting-infectious-diseases#start) projects. We will (virtually) meet every Wednesday at 11 am (US EST time). The final goal is to get a basic understanding of model-based geostatisics. The plan is to read every week a chapter from the book [P. J. Diggle, E. Giorgi (2019) - Model-based Geostatistics for Global Public Health: Methods and Applications](https://www.crcpress.com/Model-based-Geostatistics-for-Global-Public-Health-Methods-and-Applications/Diggle-Giorgi/p/book/9781138732353) and then discuss it during the meeting. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code will be also provided to reproduce the analyses in the book. We can open a [new issue](https://github.com/claudiofronterre/spatstatReading/issues) every time we want to start a discussion or ask a question. Below you will find a list with the reading materials and additional resources for every week (this space will be updated weekly). 

## Week 1 (11am US EST, October 30th)

**Zoom link**: https://psu.zoom.us/j/445971928

The topic for this week is a general introduction to spatial statistics and in particular to geostatistics.

**Reading material**: Chapter 1 of [MBG](https://www.crcpress.com/Model-based-Geostatistics-for-Global-Public-Health-Methods-and-Applications/Diggle-Giorgi/p/book/9781138732353) book.

For those interested in learning how to handle spatial data with R you can have a look at [this introductory tutorial](https://github.com/claudiofronterre/spatstatReading/blob/master/resources/week1/spatial_handouts.pdf).

## Week 2 (11am US EST, November 6th)

**Zoom link**: https://psu.zoom.us/j/445971928

In this session we will see the potential flaws of applying standard regression models to spatially reference data. We will learn what is the variogram and how we can use it to test for residual spatial correlation. 

**Reading material**: Chapter 2 of [MBG](https://www.crcpress.com/Model-based-Geostatistics-for-Global-Public-Health-Methods-and-Applications/Diggle-Giorgi/p/book/9781138732353) book.

## Week 3 (11am US EST, November 20th)

**Zoom link**: https://psu.zoom.us/j/445971928

In this session we will talk about Gaussian processes, how they are parametrised to capture spatial variabily using different families of spatial correlation functions. Then a brief introduction to stastical and predictive inference both from a frequentist and Bayesian perspective.

**Reading material**: Chapter 3 of [MBG](https://www.crcpress.com/Model-based-Geostatistics-for-Global-Public-Health-Methods-and-Applications/Diggle-Giorgi/p/book/9781138732353) book. Section 3.6 can be skipped.

## Week 4 (11am US EST, December 11th)

**Zoom link**: https://psu.zoom.us/j/445971928

In this session we will talk about the linear Geostatistical model, how to formulate it, validate its fit to a dataset and obtain spatial predictions for any target of interest.

**Reading material**: Chapter 4 of [MBG](https://www.crcpress.com/Model-based-Geostatistics-for-Global-Public-Health-Methods-and-Applications/Diggle-Giorgi/p/book/9781138732353) book.

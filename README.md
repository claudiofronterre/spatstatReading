# Spatial Statistics Reading Group
This repository contains info and materials for the Spatial Statistics Reading Group (SSRG) set up for the CONSHA and [P3H](https://impact.psu.edu/story/forecasting-infectious-diseases#start) projects. We will (virtually) meet every Wednesday at 11 am (US EST time). The final goal is to get a basic understanding of model-based geostatisics. The plan is to read every week a chapter from the book [P. J. Diggle, E. Giorgi (2019) - Model-based Geostatistics for Global Public Health: Methods and Applications](https://www.crcpress.com/Model-based-Geostatistics-for-Global-Public-Health-Methods-and-Applications/Diggle-Giorgi/p/book/9781138732353) and then discuss it during the meeting. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code will be also provided to reproduce the analyses in the book. We can open a [new issue](https://github.com/claudiofronterre/spatstatReading/issues) every time we want to start a discussion or ask a question. Below you will find a list with the reading materials and additional resources for every week (this space will be updated weekly). 

## Week 1 (11am US EST, October 30th)

**Zoom link**: https://psu.zoom.us/j/445971928

The topic for this week is a general introduction to spatial statistics and in particular to geostatistics.

**Reading material**: Chapter 1 of [MBG](https://www.crcpress.com/Model-based-Geostatistics-for-Global-Public-Health-Methods-and-Applications/Diggle-Giorgi/p/book/9781138732353) book.
